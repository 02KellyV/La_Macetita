# La Macetita

__History__
***La Macetita***, was born thanks to the search for healthy and less processed foods in the quarantine season. Life went from being outdoors to staying in our homes, many local businesses closed due to the lack of visitors and commerce moved into the virtual world. Organic foods are found little or not at all in traditional markets.

__Main Focus__
This project creates a window to the farmers' markets that may or may not have a website and indexing on the internet. We are a platform that allows the user to know the different local and national businesses, the products that they offer, the food lines, the contacts of them, among other functions.

>__Our Goal:__ 
We want to promote the organic and responsible production of organic, natural and artisanal products and food, in this way we support sustainable agriculture, organic farms, farming families and non-profit organizations.

__Demo:__ In progress our working live demo ⏳⌛
